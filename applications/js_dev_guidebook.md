## Project Overview

Douglas Butner wants to bring Javascript developers to the Antelope ecosystem with a hands-on, practical guide that will offer a guiding light to illuminate Antelope's potential over other layer-1 network solutions. 

This guide will show developers who aren't C++ geniuses how they can interact with smart contracts without leaving Javascript, and provide useful code snippets. A newcomer will be able to execute testnet transactions from their local machine within minutes of opening the guide, cultivating excitement to complete the guidebook and further engage with the Antelope ecosystem.

Any skill-level of Javascript developer will feel comfortable building in the Antelope / EOSIO ecosystem after reading this guidebook. 


Douglas's guide will compliment the highly-technical ["EOSIO Smart Contract Developer's Handbook"](dev_book.md) already funded by the ENF, which provides a deep technical understanding for serious blockchain developers, but may be over the heads of many less-experienced devs, all levels of javascript devs, and product owners considering the EOSIO / Antelope ecosystem. 



### Overview

- **Name:** Antelope Developers Guidebook

- **Brief Description:** A guidebook for Javascript developers to get up and running quickly with Antelope-based blockchains

- **Relationship to EOSIO:** The guidebook serves to onboard the massive Javascript developer community to EOSIO- and Antelope-based blockchains.

- **Reason for Interest:** Douglas is a prolific javascript developer, passionate teacher and unwaveringly enthusiastic promoter of EOSIO and Antelope technology. 


### Project Details

The guidebook, built on Gitbook, is targeting all-levels of Javascript developers who want to: 
1) Get up and running quickly by: 
    a) reading from the blockchain via public APIs
    b) sending transactions on EOSIO- and Antelope-based blockchains
2) Understand the ecosystem, including APIs, and popular projects like Atomic Assets. 
3) Rapidly develop Antelope-native dapps from available open-source contracts. 


Topics to be covered within this grant application:

- Introducing various APIs for reading and writing on-chain data, catering to the needs and background of Javascript developers

- Providing links to the lists of public endpoints for the different Antelope-based blockchains

- Reading the token balance from a specific user, top holders of a coin

- Reading information from any table 

- Sending a transfer transaction using Javascript

- Updating mutable data of a NFT using Javascript

- Using Javascript to schedule transactions in the future or on a recurring basis 

- Creating a permission structure and using a private key with limited permissions to be used in an environment variable in Javascript

- Briefly reviewing and comparing available open-source contracts

- Compiling and launching an open-source C++ smart contract



Additional topics for future grant applications:

- Examining the differences between popular Antelope chains

- Using oracles to fetch outside information

- Using RNGs (random number generators) and other useful game mechanics

- Explaining the steps to listing a novelty token on a DEX, and opening a swap pool

- Detailed example for a staking contract for NFTs

- Detailed example of a staking contract for eosio.token-compatible fungible tokens

- A detailed explanation of practical use cases involving open-source contracts





### Ecosystem Fit

We supplement the existing [EOSIO Smart Contract Developer's Handbook](dev_book.md) and improve the overall ecosystem by providing an easier, shorter on-ramp to a becoming an Antelope developer. We aim for little to no overlap between with the EOSIO Smart Contract Developer's Handbook, and will link to it where appropriate.

This guidebook honors Antelope's best-in-market core technology by highlighting the performance and ease of development from the perspective of an experienced developer, in the voice of a trusted teacher. 

This guidebook will shift focus towards the core protocol, striking a balance with the recent attention garnered by the EVM. 

By showing developers how easy it is to interact directly with the blockchain without leaving Javascript, we believe we can bring new developers, projects, and economic value to the ecosystem.

## Development Status

To gain the needed expertise, Douglas has built a [top-100 NFT collectors rewards system](https://waxblock.io/account/nfts.cxc) and a [leveled-NFT staking solution with fungible token rewards](https://waxblock.io/account/everpay.cxc) both dispatched from Javascript. 

Douglas has started to compile useful but hard-to-find information for developers like [headers](https://github.com/TetraGrids/ANT-headers) and [smart contracts organized by utility](https://github.com/dougbutner/ANTools).

Douglas has opened the Gitbook on https://antbook.douglas.life/ pending grant approval for further work.
